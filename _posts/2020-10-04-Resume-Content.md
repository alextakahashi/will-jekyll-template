# 📝 Resume Content - Convince Me WHY You're the Right Candidate

> TL;DR - Your resume should be tailored to the job application.  Each and every bullet point should build your case why you're a prime candidate for the job role.

NOTE: This post is primarily applicable to upcoming University Grads recruiting for a technical role (Software Engineering), but the principles here should be relevant to any resume.

Addressing common questions / patterns in resumes to put your best foot forward when the recruiter dives into your experiences.

* How long should my resume be?  What experiences do I include?
* Should I put my GPA on my resume?
* How do I keep the recruiter's attention?

Previously, I detailed [Structuring Your Resume and Why It Matters](https://alextakahashi.github.io/Structuring-Your-Resume/) to make a strong first impression for recruitment.  The content of the resume should build a persuasive case why you're right for the job.  Jump straight to the point and hit the ground running with tips for each of the sections below.

1. Contact Information
2. Education
3. Skills
4. Professional Experience
5. Projects
6. Awards/Acknowledgements

## Contact Information

**Include your Personal Website, Github/Bitbucket, and LinkedIn**.  All these items show that you go above and beyond in your preparation for recruitment.

> Q. Do people actually look at these? 

A.  Yes, I would check to see if any of these are on included on a resume.  No, I would not necessarily visit these links.

Inclusion of these implies you have some knowledge of web + version control + online recruitment.  All good signs that you are in the know.

## Education

> Q. What is your education background?  Did you study in a technical field?  

For most of you, this will be your University + Major.  Recruiters are looking for someone who has a technical background, it is okay to have a non technical major / minor in the case that your work/project experience is strong.

Other educational background - include your Coding Bootcamp experience if applicable.  Avoid including High School information since your Higher Education background should be sufficient - use this space on your resume to include more experiences.

> Q. When are you graduating?

This determines how soon you are eligible for Full Time Work.  Recruiters want to convert interns to full time.

> Q. What courses were taken to support this person as a strong candidate?

Only include courses that speak to the role you're applying to.  Definitely include your techinal courses, *Data Structures + Algorithms*, *Linear Algebra*, *Discrete Math*, etc.  Do not include introduction courses + irrelevant courses (*Intro to Japanese*, *Intro to Python*).  Use generalized course names - not their number.  Recruiters will not know what CS170 is, explicitly mention as Efficient Algorithms.

> Q. Is GPA mentioned on the resume?

GPA is not required especially for the technical field.  GPA is not necessarily a good indicator if someone will be successful for the job - your Work Experience + Professional Experience should make up for any GPA gaps.  Only include your GPA if its strong (3.0+).  

I kept my GPA off my resume - admittedly I did not do so hot in college grade wise!  My experiences made up for the gaps in my resume to push me through my recruitment.

## Skills

> Q. Does the candidate have experience with industry tools?

This section can sound like a laundry list.  Your Work + Project Experience should go in depth about some of the tools that are listed.

* *Languages*: Put the language you are most comfortable with first.  Follow with other languages you are familiar with / would be comfortable talking about in case recruitment / engineers ask specific questions.
* *Frameworks*: Put common Libraries that you use.  Ex: UIKit, XCTest
* *Tools*: Put other tools you've used, Postman, Git Clients, Package Managers, etc.

These buckets can be bundled together however you think makes logical sense + looks clean on your resume.

## Experience

This is the most important part of your resume - the main deciding factor if you will move forward in the process.

Bullet points should follow the following format:

> "I did X for Y to accomplish Z"

This formulaic approach hits what recruiters are looking for:

* *What exaclty did the candidate do?*
* *How did the candidate execute this?  What tools/Technologies?  Is this applicable for the role?*
* *Why is this important?  What impact resulted from the candidates contribution?*

# Conclusion + Next Steps

I hope reading this post makes you revisit your resume and question if your structure is easily digestable for recruitment to pass you through to the next stage. The structure is the first hurdle to jump through when the recruiter is skimming through your work, the next is your content — the make it or break it moment of your recruitment process. In my next post I will dive deeper into each of the sections about what content should be included and how to communicate your impact.
